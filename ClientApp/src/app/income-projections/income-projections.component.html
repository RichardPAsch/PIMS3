    <!--This is the ag-grid component definition, with two property bindings - rowData and columnDefs.
        The component also accepts the standard DOM style and class. We have set the class to ag-theme-balham,
        which defines the grid theme. As you may have already noticed, the CSS class matches the name of CSS
        file we imported earlier.-->
